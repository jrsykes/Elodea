Some weights of DeformableDetrForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at SenseTime/deformable-detr and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_embed.0.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.0.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.1.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.1.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.2.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.2.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.3.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.3.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.4.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.4.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.5.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.5.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
