/local/scratch/jrs596/envs/d-detr2/lib/python3.7/site-packages/transformers/models/detr/image_processing_detr.py:776: FutureWarning: The `max_size` parameter is deprecated and will be removed in v4.26. Please specify in `size['longest_edge'] instead`.
  FutureWarning,
Some weights of DeformableDetrForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at SenseTime/deformable-detr and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_embed.0.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.0.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.1.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.1.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.2.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.2.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.3.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.3.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.4.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.4.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.5.weight: found shape torch.Size([91, 256]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1, 256]) in the model instantiated
- class_embed.5.bias: found shape torch.Size([91]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([1]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` (try 12 which is the number of cpus on this machine) in the `DataLoader` init to improve performance.
